## Our current parades!

* 2023 Egg Harbor City Halloween Parade

We have our trailer decorated, but if you would like to bring additional decorations that can be zip tied that would be fun!

5:30 PM line up, we will be finishing decorations on the trailer.  It might be advisable to bring a wagon for littles in the event the trailer is not large enough to accomodate everyone.  I will have two wagons available.  Come in costume, and maybe integrate your class B uniform shirt into the costume (worn over your Werewolf ! :) )

Thank you for participating!  Candy will be available to be thrown (700+ dum dum lollipops), but if you would like to bring extra that would also be appreciated.

[Line up will be on Cladius Street, usually around the intersection of London Ave.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jbi3Fma8FNfimY7RA)
